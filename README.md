# semester-project2
DESCRIPTION During the rise of the covid-19 pandemic, and lockdown we were reminded of the need to be able to get a few things done from home without having to take an inch out of your comfort zone, and get your desired items delivered to you at your beck and call. Also, we have quite a number of bread companies who do well like the A1 bread producers and co. who would make pretty good use of this app delivering to their customers who are desiring their products from far and near. This app has been designed to help customers request and get their favourite items delivered straight to their door steps.
